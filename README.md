¹ *Network Slice SLA Compliance: Percentage of time network slices meet their contractual performance targets including latency (<1ms for URLLC), throughput guarantees (minimum Mbps for eMBB), and availability (99.999% uptime)*

² *5G Spectrum Efficiency: Measured in bits per second per Hertz (bps/Hz) across 5G frequency bands including sub-6 GHz (3.5 GHz, n77/n78) and mmWave (28 GHz, 39 GHz) bands*

## 📊 5G Network Performance Monitoring

**Network Slicing Analytics**
Real-time monitoring of network slice performance with separate KPIs for eMBB (enhanced mobile broadband), URLLC (ultra-reliable low latency), and mMTC (massive machine-type communications) slices.

**Spectrum Utilization Tracking**
Monitors spectrum efficiency across different frequency bands (sub-6 GHz, mmWave) with utilization heatmaps and optimization recommendations.

**Service Quality Metrics**
Tracks user experience indicators like throughput, latency, packet loss, and call quality across different service types and geographic areas.

**OpenRAN Performance Analysis**
Monitors performance of disaggregated RAN components including RU, DU, and CU with vendor-agnostic KPI tracking.

## 🔧 Advanced 5G Features

**Dynamic Network Slicing**
Monitors and adjusts network slice resources based on real-time demand. Automatically scales slice bandwidth and priority based on service requirements and traffic patterns.

**Spectrum Optimization Engine**
Analyzes spectrum usage patterns and recommends carrier aggregation configurations, beam forming adjustments, and frequency reallocation to maximize efficiency.

**Edge Computing Integration**
Tracks Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) performance and automatically routes traffic to optimal edge nodes based on latency requirements and compute availability.

**AI-Driven Performance Tuning**
Machine learning algorithms identify optimization opportunities for antenna tilt, power levels, and handover parameters to improve overall network performance.
