¹ *Network Slice SLA Compliance: Percentage of time network slices meet their contractual performance targets including latency (<1ms for URLLC), throughput guarantees (minimum Mbps for eMBB), and availability (99.999% uptime)*

² *5G Spectrum Efficiency: Measured in bits per second per Hertz (bps/Hz) across 5G frequency bands including sub-6 GHz (3.5 GHz, n77/n78) and mmWave (28 GHz, 39 GHz) bands*

## 📊 5G Network Performance Monitoring

**Network Slicing Analytics**
Real-time monitoring of network slice performance with separate KPIs for eMBB (enhanced mobile broadband), URLLC (ultra-reliable low latency), and mMTC (massive machine-type communications) slices.

**Spectrum Utilization Tracking**
Monitors spectrum efficiency across different frequency bands (sub-6 GHz, mmWave) with utilization heatmaps and optimization recommendations.

**Service Quality Metrics**
Tracks user experience indicators like throughput, latency, packet loss, and call quality across different service types and geographic areas.

**OpenRAN Performance Analysis**
Monitors performance of disaggregated RAN components including RU, DU, and CU with vendor-agnostic KPI tracking.

## 🔧 Advanced 5G Features

**Dynamic Network Slicing**
Manages slice resource allocation with real-time demand patterns. Balances slice isolation requirements against resource efficiency while monitoring performance impacts across all slice types to maintain service quality guarantees.

**Spectrum Optimization Engine**
Analyzes spectrum usage patterns and recommends carrier aggregation configurations. Considers regulatory constraints and interference patterns when suggesting frequency reallocation strategies for maximum efficiency across deployment scenarios.

**Edge Computing Integration**
Tracks Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) performance and automatically routes traffic to optimal edge nodes based on latency requirements and compute availability.

**AI-Driven Performance Tuning**
Machine learning algorithms identify optimization opportunities for antenna tilt, power levels, and handover parameters. Continuously adapts to changing network conditions while balancing coverage, capacity, and power efficiency objectives across multiple optimization cycles.
